GeneticBytecode
===============

Bytecode compiler and genetic algorithm - another one of my old ideas. This time in C++.

As far as I remember it was supposed to randomly generate a long bytecode sequence, run this bytecode through a compiler (one instruction at a time as the generated program could modify itself) and at the end use genetic algorithm to create the next population of bytecode sequences.
